# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for this project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## Why Use ADRs?

- **Historical Context**: Understand why decisions were made
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Onboard new team members faster
- **Decision Tracking**: Keep track of architectural evolution
- **Prevent Rehashing**: Avoid revisiting settled decisions
- **Consequences Awareness**: Understand trade-offs made

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Initial draft, under discussion
2. **Accepted**: Decision approved and adopted
3. **Deprecated**: Decision no longer relevant but kept for history
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision (link to new ADR)

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy `0000-adr-template.md` to a new file
2. Name it with the next number: `XXXX-short-title.md`
3. Fill in all sections
4. Submit for review
5. Update status when approved

## ADR Naming Convention

Format: `XXXX-short-descriptive-title.md`

Examples:
- `0001-use-slnx-format.md`
- `0002-choose-logging-framework.md`
- `0003-database-selection.md`
